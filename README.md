- ./wallpapers
    - just pictures to use as wallpapers
- ./sysfiles
    - copies of dotfiles from ~
    - needs maintinance as updates are made
    - currently minimal
- TBD

## Purpose
Just trying to get configs saved out as I make them. This will eventually be built out bigger and better as more linux distros are configured, app build sets made/determined and common makefiles etc are created for different use cases.  Will update as needed.
